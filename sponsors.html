<p>
	Toaster Tech is a 501(c)(3) non-profit robotics team hosted by LEAD’s (Learners and Educators of Atlanta and Decatur). We participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition, where every year students build a robot to compete with and against other teams. This international competition is comprised of design and building challenges, where students gain important skills in teamwork, strategy, science and engineering, and business, where we strive to foster good relations. 

Our goals this year are to build a competitive robot, to expand our outreach efforts in promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) in the Greater Atlanta area, and the ultimate goal of competing in the FIRST Championships in Saint Louis.  Our intention is to participate in two regional events to impact more students by growing our team, and by becoming a positive force in our community.

As a home school-based organization, Toaster Tech depends on the funding provided by sponsors. On average, parts cost around $4,000 per year, to register for an event is about $3,500, and with a possible total of 3 events including championships, $14,500 is an accurate annual cost with all added overall. Overhead costs include food, transportation, general tools.

	If you would like to become a sponsor, please email us at leadfrc@googlegroups.com or call 404.312.5506.

— Matthew Gilchrist, senior member of Toaster Tech
